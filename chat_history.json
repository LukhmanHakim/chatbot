Now they're saying \"i want to ask.\" It seems like they're leading up to a question but haven't asked it yet. I should encourage them to go ahead and ask whatever they need. Maybe they're a bit hesitant or unsure, so I'll keep it friendly and open. I'll let them know I'm here to help with whatever they need.\n\n\nOf course! Feel free to ask whatever you'd like, and I'll do my best to help."}]}
